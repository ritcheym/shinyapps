Shiny Apps
--------------
### Simple ROC
* This Shiny app demonstrates key concepts in signal detection and the influence of key parameters on receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves.
* User controls discriminability, decision criterion, and relative variance of target distribution.
* The app plots the density function, ROC, and zROC, dynamically updating with user input.
* [Live demo](http://www.datadetective.org/apps/simple-roc/)

### Dual-Process ROC
* This Shiny app demonstrates the dual process model of recognition memory (Yonelinas, 1994) and the influence of familiarity and recollection on receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves.
* User controls the recollection parameter, familiarity parameter, and decision criterion.
* The app plots the density function, ROC, and zROC, dynamically updating with user input.
